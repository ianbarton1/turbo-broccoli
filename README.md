# Turbo Broccoli

Turbo Broccoli is a plant watering assistant, Turbo Broccoli helps plan daily watering walks around your plant collection
you can define zones within your collection to better organise your watering activities.

The application uses a 'feedback' based system to determine watering intervals, however you will still require a good idea of when it
is suitable to water your plants.

At the momemnt this software is very much a work in progress, but I will be adding more functionality to it as time progresses.
I will personally be using this software to take care of my moderate plant collection for the forseeable future so it will be updated
according to my own needs.
